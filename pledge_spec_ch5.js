Chapter 5: Utility Functions for Fun & Profit
---------------------------------------------------------
Wow! If you got this far, congratulations. We omitted certain
details (e.g. handlers must always be called in a true async
wrapper), but you have built a promise library with most of
the standard behavior. If you are up to it, there are a few
indispensable secondary methods that will be good to understand.
